# reduced_order_method
The combination of autoencoder and transformer is used to build a reduced-order model for identifying the amplitude-frequency response and reconstructing the time-history response. Galerkin truncation is applied for initial reduction, followed by autoencoder for precise reduction, capturing dominant modes.
