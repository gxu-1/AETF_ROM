# reduced_order_method
The combination of autoencoder and transformer is used to build a reduced-order model for identifying the amplitude-frequency response and reconstructing the time-history response. Galerkin truncation is applied for initial reduction, followed by autoencoder for precise reduction, capturing dominant modes.
The combination of autoencoder and transformer is used for building a reduced-order model, with the autoencoder handling dimensionality reduction and the transformer constructing the low-dimensional dynamic model. This method is effective for identifying the amplitude-frequency response of the reduced model and reconstructing the structural time-history response. In this approach, Galerkin truncation is first applied for initial dimensionality reduction, extracting high-order modal data. The autoencoder is then used for precise reduction to capture the dominant modes, which are input into the transformer to establish the potential low-dimensional model.

The elastic cable-stayed bridge is used as an example, demonstrating the process of dimensionality reduction and response reconstruction. Notably, the autoencoder works in the latent space, so a conversion factor (Î») between the latent and physical coordinates is set to 1.1 to align the two spaces. This combined methodology allows for efficient extraction of essential dynamics and accurate reconstruction of time-history responses, with the transformer capturing the low-dimensional dynamics.
